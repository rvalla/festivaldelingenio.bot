# Festival del Ingenio: telegram bot

This is the code for a telegram bot. The idea is to have fun with the public of **Festival del ingenio**, an event
which take place in Buenos Aires every year. It is part of the family of **Celebration of mind**.  

## online status

**Festival del Ingenio Bot** is not currently deployed. It will be available during some moments of the week while I run
some tests. Stay tuned!

## commands

Here you can see the list of available commands. Some of them allow you to pass parameters.

- **/start**: returns simply a greeting.  
- **/rebuses**:
- **/palindromos**:
- **/video**:
- **/help**:

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): the programming language I used.  
- [**python-telegram-bot**](https://python-telegram-bot.org/): the library I used to contact the *Telegram API*.
